VTOLVR Modding aims to add more user-created content into the game as mods. With the mod loader, players can add custom code into the game to add extra features that they wanted.
Anyone can create mods with a bit of knowledge of Unity and C# using the Wiki, also the mod loader is open source, so anyone can help out improving the mod loader it's self.

Please note, modding in VTOL VR isn't officially supported by the developers. Mods will break from time to time, this isn't the developers' fault, please don't blame them or report bugs to the developers while running the mod loader or any mods. If there are any issues with the mod loader, please report them to @. Marsh.Mello .#3194 on the [official VTOLVR Discord](https://discord.gg/u7X72wc "official VTOLVR Discord").



## Contributing to the mod loader
This is this all the source code for the launcher, mod loader.dll, logo files and unity project. 
This project is open-source, so anyone can help out improving. Just create a fork, improve upon the code, and do a pull request. However, if you just want to create a mod you don't need to touch this source code, head over to the [creating a mod page](https://vtolvr-mods.com/creating-a-mod.php "creating a mod page") on the website to learn how.

The logo was created in Adobe Illustrator and the gif was created in Adobe Photoshop.
Modloader, Installer and Launcher are all in one visual studio project in C#.
