The mod loader now injects its self into the game so you can load mods in VR. To launch the game modded, all you have to press is launch and wait for the game to open. It will wait a few seconds and inject its self into the game. Then from inside the game, you can load mods in the singleplayer section.

## How to create mods (Wiki is currently out of date)

Mods are created in C# in Visual Studio using the .net framework. Creating these mods are just like creating your own script in Unity, so if you have experience in writing C# scripts in Unity you can check out my more detailed post in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MarshMello0/VTOLVR-ModLoader/wiki).
